# ‚≠ê DEFINITIVE FIX: Use the most robust absolute path format for Temurin JRE images.
# We must ensure the 'java' executable is found using a known path structure.
# The default location is often /usr/local/openjdk-XX/bin/java or similar.
# Let's try the /usr/local path, which is often manually set by the image maintainer.
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/openjdk-25/bin/java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
